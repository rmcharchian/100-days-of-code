### Day 1: April 3, 2018
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100 Days of Code Log, hoping to work on more later this evening.  1 hours worth!

**Thoughts:** I am apprehenisve about 100 days when 30 days was a struggle.  I can do this!

### Day 2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm working on a personal project and trying to get user registration to work.  Realized I was mixing E5 and E6 in some places were it doesn't work.  I'm going back through my code to make sure everything is flowing correctly to get username and password to Postico, but not there yet.  Getting more lines of console log to work, but still getting error.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing this challenge because I need to be sure I'm coding and getting the reps.  I read a great thread on Reddit last night that explained how learning to code is like learning to play an instrument.

### Day 3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hip, hip, hooray!!!  I got my user registration to work.  It wasn't working, asked my old cohort if anyone had time to look at my code and Adam came to the rescue.  I hadn't registered my router in server.js.  Also, I figured out I wasn't referencing my Postico database correctly.  Once I made those changes it worked!

**Thoughts:** Don't be afraid to ask for help.  When you hit a wall, take the dog for a walk.

### Day 4: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today my heart just wasn't in it.  I have registration working, but login doesn't work.  I know I little refresher on SQL/Postico because I need to build my tables and have them link.  Some of the data that will come in will need to be after the user logs in.  I need to prioritize my project and bounce all over the place.  In the meantime, I decided to spend some time on freecodecamp for simple refreshers.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to be doing 100 days of code, but today I'm just not there.  Will be sure to take steps forward rather than steps back.

### Day 5: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: This morning I regrouped.  I started a Trello Board to keep track of my tasks and to more easily add questions that I will find answers to later.  I also worked on my SQL DB.  I haven't worked on one in awhile and it's good to back.  It's a great tool and I need to keep my skills fresh.  Looking forward to working on it a little more later today.

**Thoughts:** I need to remember that not each day is going to be a banner day.  Yesterday was not, and that's ok.  Today was a good day, but no parade because some great thing is working or a problem fixed.  Just organizaiton and some DB writing.  It's good.
