# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2018
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100 Days of Code Log, hoping to work on more later this evening.  1 hours worth!

**Thoughts:** I am apprehenisve about 100 days when 30 days was a struggle.  I can do this!

### Day 2: April 4, 2018
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I'm working on a personal project and trying to get user registration to work.  Realized I was mixing E5 and E6 in some places were it doesn't work.  I'm going back through my code to make sure everything is flowing correctly to get username and password to Postico, but not there yet.  Getting more lines of console log to work, but still getting error.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing this challenge because I need to be sure I'm coding and getting the reps.  I read a great thread on Reddit last night that explained how learning to code is like learning to play an instrument.

### Day 3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hip, hip, hooray!!!  I got my user registration to work.  It wasn't working, asked my old cohort if anyone had time to look at my code and Adam came to the rescue.  I hadn't registered my router in server.js.  Also, I figured out I wasn't referencing my Postico database correctly.  Once I made those changes it worked!

**Thoughts:** Don't be afraid to ask for help.  When you hit a wall, take the dog for a walk.

### Day 4: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today my heart just wasn't in it.  I have registration working, but login doesn't work.  I know I little refresher on SQL/Postico because I need to build my tables and have them link.  Some of the data that will come in will need to be after the user logs in.  I need to prioritize my project and bounce all over the place.  In the meantime, I decided to spend some time on freecodecamp for simple refreshers.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to be doing 100 days of code, but today I'm just not there.  Will be sure to take steps forward rather than steps back.

### Day 5: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: This morning I regrouped.  I started a Trello Board to keep track of my tasks and to more easily add questions that I will find answers to later.  I also worked on my SQL DB.  I haven't worked on one in awhile and it's good to back.  It's a great tool and I need to keep my skills fresh.  Looking forward to working on it a little more later today.

**Thoughts:** I need to remember that not each day is going to be a banner day.  Yesterday was not, and that's ok.  Today was a good day, but no parade because some great thing is working or a problem fixed.  Just organizaiton and some DB writing.  It's good.

### Day 6: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I thought through which html I would need to set up to also think through my DB.  I worked on both addQuestion.html and DB.  There are some file types I don't know how to save into the DB yet, and I'll need to learn it.

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much time coding today as I wanted to, but I did spend the day with my family and truly enjoyed their company.  Some Sunday's are pretty wonderful.

### Day 7: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I went down a little PostgreSQL rabbit hole, but think I figured out what I needed to know.  I'll give it a try, but also needed to head out to appts.

**Thoughts:** Brought laptop with me to get a little more coding in.  I like how mobile it can be.  One of the reasons I wanted to move into this career. I like that 10 years from now I can be almost anywere and work on code.  For now, I need to concentrate on finding an opportunity where I can worked with senior developers and be a sponge.

### Day 8: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the askQuestion route but don't have it pushing data to the DB yet.  The example I'm working from only pushes one piece of information at a time, so I need to make sure the Submit button will push all that I'm asking it to.  I'm not sure if I need to have one table or the three I'm currently working from: games, questions, answers.  

**Thoughts:** It was nice to walk through the whole route again.  I think what I have coded will work once I figure out my DB questions regarding pushing data.

### Day 9: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: This morning I wanted to try to get my new data to push to DB and worked on the controler and service.  It feels like it's almost there, but it still isn't working.  Sigh.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying hard to not have imposter syndrome and would like to be at a place where I'm more seasoned.  I just need reps and time.  What I do know is I'm not standing in the closet crying because it doesn't work.  I'm just giving the sigh that goes along with it.

### Day 10: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did get some code in this morning, but haven't been able to spend more time on it like I wanted to.  I'm still struggling a little with how to set up my SQL DB.  I decided today to take advantage of the sale for FrontEndMasters and signed up for it.  There is a SQL lesson, and many others I would like to do.  I worked on getting the SQL lesson set up, but was having a hard time getting it to connect with Git.  Then, we had to hop in the car and drive back from Milwaukee, pick up Audrey, pick up the dog, go to the dog park, get dinner, and now I'm home and exhausted.  Will hit it again FRESH in the morning.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes life get's in the way of our plans.  But, would any of the plans be worth it if it were not for the life?

### Day 11: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Somedays we have to be a little lose in our defination of progress.  Today, progress was figuring out which Git command I was missing to clone something that SHOULD have been easy to clone.  From this day forward, I will never forget the importance of "git remote rename origin upstream".

**Thoughts:** I should just spend one whole day playing with Git.  Sigh.

### Day 12: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not as much progess as I had hoped for.  Started the Frontend Masters SQL Fundamentals course, but can't get it to run on local host.  Feeling very frustrated, but put question out on Slack to see if anyone else has had this issue.

**Thoughts:** Today I have imposter syndrome.  It is what it is.

### Day 13: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I coded a little, but was also playing April 2018 Blizzard and shoveled, played board games, ate leftovers.  I should have recorded what I worked on, but only realized today (Day 15) that I didn't log it.

**Thoughts:** Special circumstance

### Day 14: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I did get some of the buttons on the nav bar of personal project to work.  Didn't get as much coding time in as I had hoped to.  But, today was Paul's birthday and we were having his family over for dinner.  Didn't get to run any errands over the weekend, and had to do all of it today.

**Thoughts:**  Excuses!  Not really, this weekend we didn't leave the house because of the blizzard.

### Day 15: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I coded on my project a little before I left the house, but then worked on Frontend Masters and Code Pen now that I'm out running errands, between appts.  Again, I love how mobile this is.  I just wish I was a little more seasoned.

**Thoughts:**  I want to have time to do this all day, every day.  I would be so much better at it.

### Day 16: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: TodayI got sidetracked by CSS and adding an image.  I know this is stuff people get stuck in the rabbit hole on.  Once you get started you just want it to work.  I finally have an image and tomorrow I will adjust the location of the image.

**Thoughts:**  I can't believe I'm already on Day 16.

### Day 17: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some buttons and the flow of some of the pages of my personal project.  There is alot it does, and I need to remember to make it more simple rather than more layered.  If that makes sense.

**Thoughts:**  I didn't spend as much time on this as I had hoped to.  But, it's 50 degrees out.  I know that shouldn't make a difference, but we just had a blizzard.  Needed to take dog on an extra long walk today.
