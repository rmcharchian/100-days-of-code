**Today's Progress**: I'm working on a personal project and trying to get user registration to work.  Realized I was mixing E5 and E6 in some places were it doesn't work.  I'm going back through my code to make sure everything is flowing correctly to get username and password to Postico, but not there yet.  Getting more lines of console log to work, but still getting error.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing this challenge because I need to be sure I'm coding and getting the reps.  I read a great thread on Reddit last night that explained how learning to code is like learning to play an instrument.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
